# Project description
In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect.
It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and
then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier.

 that shares the findings I found most interesting which clearly communicate what broad conclusions I want to make, and provide a visual or numeric values associated with the findings.

 This data used for the project was collected from Udacity students who responded to a survey. This result cannot be extrapolated to the whole Udacity students.
